# Networks Lab 3: OpenFlow

## Overview
The objective of this lab is to establish a network connection between hosts and then implement rules that control which packets are accepted or dropped by various network components (e.g., hosts, servers).

This lab utilizes the **POX controller** to access OpenFlow functionalities and define custom packet-handling behaviors across the network.

## Goals
- Establish communication between network hosts.
- Define and apply packet-filtering rules using the OpenFlow protocol.
- Control traffic flow within the network based on user-defined rules.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- POX Controller
- OpenFlow
