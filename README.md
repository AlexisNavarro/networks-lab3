# networks-lab3 Open Flow

The purpose of this lab is to be able to create a connection between hosts and once that connection is established, then the main objective is to implement a set of rules on what packets will be accepted by the hosts, servers
anything that connects within the network. For this lab, I will be using POX libraries to be able to access the openflow functionality to create rules for packets beign transferred over the network.
